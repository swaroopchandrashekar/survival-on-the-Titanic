Project Overview
This project focuses on applying various machine learning algorithms to predict passenger survival. The core objectives include:
- Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on passenger information (e.g., age, sex, socio-economic class).
- Building and tuning classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest) to improve prediction accuracy.
- Documenting findings and best practices for future reference.

Data Description
The Titanic dataset typically includes the following columns:
- PassengerId: Unique identifier for each passenger.
- Survived: Survival indicator (0 = Did not survive, 1 = Survived).
- Pclass: Ticket class (1 = First, 2 = Second, 3 = Third).
- Name: Name of the passenger.
- Sex: Passenger's gender.
- Age: Passenger's age.
- SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard.
- Parch: Number of parents/children aboard.
- Ticket: Ticket number.
- Fare: Ticket fare.
- Cabin: Cabin number.
- Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton).


## Modeling Approach
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identifying missing values, outliers, and significant features.  
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Dealing with missing values, encoding categorical variables, performing feature scaling.  
3. **Feature Engineering**: Combining or transforming features, deriving new insights from existing data.  
4. **Model Training**: Training different classification algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.) and tuning hyperparameters.  
5. **Evaluation**: Comparing models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Results
- Best Model: Random Forest (example) with 84% accuracy on the test dataset (add actual metrics).
- Features of Importance: Passenger class, gender, and embarked location contributed most significantly to the model (example).
